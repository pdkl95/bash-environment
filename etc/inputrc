##### that is, if you had alread typed
#####    echo foo bar baz
##### no matter the point is now, you end here
#####    echo _ foo bar baz
##### a single space is added to so the point is
##### _between_ whitespace.
##### This is very similar to the next macro, but stays
##### within the current command only, without touching
##### the history
# <alt>+2
#"\e2": "[1;5C "

##### load the previous comand, and edit
##### move to enter the FIRST option
##### example, if the previos command was:
#####     prog foo bar baz
##### Then pressin C-f would scroll up oneto the history
##### log to that commmand, and put the editing point
##### at the where the section marker indicates here:
#####     prog _ foo bar baz
##### A single extra space is also added such that the point
##### is now _between_ spaces and is read for something else
##### to be entered.

    ##### in the newly copied "foo/" directory. It does an
